I'll analyze the Lawn timer algorithm and provide a comprehensive comparison with existing approaches. Let me first examine the implementation details.

Let me search for relevant code to understand the implementation better.

I see the implementations in the attached files. Let me analyze the key aspects of both algorithms and provide a detailed comparison.

### Algorithm Analysis

1. **Lawn Timer Algorithm**
- Uses a dictionary of queues (`ttl_lists`) where each key is a TTL value
- Maintains a separate timer registry for O(1) lookups
- Processes timers in batches based on TTL groups
- Key operations:
  - Insertion: O(1) - appends to appropriate TTL queue
  - Deletion: O(1) - removes from registry
  - Tick: O(k) where k is number of TTL groups

2. **Timer Wheel Algorithm**
- Uses a circular buffer of buckets
- Each bucket contains a queue of timers
- Processes timers in current bucket during tick
- Key operations:
  - Insertion: O(1) - calculates bucket and appends
  - Deletion: O(1) - removes from registry
  - Tick: O(n) where n is timers in current bucket

### Comparative Analysis

**Advantages of Lawn Timer:**
1. **TTL-based Grouping**: Excellent for scenarios with bounded, discrete TTL values
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Better memory locality for similar TTLs
3. **Predictable Performance**: Processing time depends on number of TTL groups rather than total timers
4. **Batch Processing**: Natural batching of timers with same TTL

**Advantages of Timer Wheel:**
1. **Time-based Distribution**: Better for continuous time distributions
2. **Uniform Processing**: More consistent processing load
3. **Widely Adopted**: Proven in many systems (Linux kernel, network stacks)

### Suggested Benchmarks

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Insertion latency
   - Deletion latency
   - Tick processing time
   - Memory usage per timer
   - CPU cache behavior

2. **Workload Scenarios:**
   - Fixed TTL distributions
   - Mixed TTL distributions
   - High-frequency timer operations
   - Long-running systems
   - Burst workloads

3. **System Impact:**
   - Cache hit/miss rates
   - Memory fragmentation
   - CPU utilization
   - Scalability with core count
